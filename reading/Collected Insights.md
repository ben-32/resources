In Skinner's experiments, pidgeons were trained to peck a button for food. If the reward was consistent, they'd peck when hungry. If the reward was inconsistent, they'd peck like crazy.

Jeff Patton thinks companies are the same. They release a feature, and sometimes it goes well. They don't understand why. So they become addicted to releasing software. People put more effort into things that *might* succeed than things they know *will*.

From [Game Dev 101.2 Get Pro](https://medium.com/@EdStern/game-dev-101-2-get-pro-6455e185743) by Ed Stern:

- On a wider horizon, learn about the fundamental realities of the industry you want to enter, not just the practice of your specialisation. Get a sense of the economics of it, because that’s going to define the climate you’ll be working in, not just the weather.
- It’s horribly simple. Don’t just do stuff you find easy. You’ll learn more from finishing a small bad thing than never quite finishing something “Great”.
- I hate starting things. I love having finished them.
- If you can do a thing straight away, do it straight away. That way you can’t forget, and you won’t waste energy stressing that you haven’t done it.
- Also “Not Choosing Yet” is a choice, it just doesn’t feel like one. Try to make active choices in your life. Don’t let stuff just happen to you.
- You can only TAKE Time: choose to leave something undone so you can do something else.
- Always take notes. I use index cards in a bulldog clip so I can carry them everywhere and easily hand info over as a physical object.
- Your ideas don’t matter.

- A lot of people spend so much time working at top speed and still feel like they are falling behind because they haven’t worked on the things that matter the most. (needed (nice-to-have) and required (must-have)) [conscious failure]
- Schedule Time to Work on Tasks
- Focus and Avoid Distractions

When everything is urgent, nothing is

Because we can’t do it all, saying no is important. It helps protect your time so you can focus on what truly matters.

Because saying yes means saying no to something else—often something we need to focus on to continue to grow.

Empowered refusal is a compelling way of saying no because it stems from who you are — from your identity.

Once you’ve done these two things, you can connect with the person asking so that they understand your no.
