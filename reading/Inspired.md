# Lessons from Inspired by Marty Cagan

## Chapter 1
- A product organisation should have 5 roles:
  - Product Manager: Assesses opportunities
  - UX Designer
  - Project Manager: Scheduling, releases, tracking
  - Engineering
  - Marketing
- Product should be: valuable, usable, feasible

## Chapter 4
- Product roles (one person may fill more than one, in a small organisation)
- Product roles are: interaction (UX) design, visual design, prototyping, usability testing (with real users)

## Chapter  5
- Outsource for the right reasons (to get talent)
- Ensure 20% of engineering devoted to tech debt / rework

## Chapter  11
- Product Opportunity Assesment
  - Lightweight
  - What is the problem, who will we solve it for, how big is the market, what is success, who are competitors, why are we best suited to solve it
    why now, how will we get it to market, what is critical to success
  - Determines whether to go ahead or not (i.e., avoid waste resources)
  - Alternative to heavyweight Market Requirements Document (MRD) prepared by business or marketing
  - Will help understand problem and how to make solution, but should NOT describe the solution itself

## Chapter  12
- Product discovery and execution need different mindsets (exploring new ideas during execution causes churn)
- While Release 1 is being executed, discovery can happen for Release 2 (try to defer new ideas to next release)
- Product discovery is unpredictable and hard to schedule (be wary of engineering making something low-value just because they're ready to start)
  - I would have engineering work on tech debt if the product spec isn't ready yet

## Chapter  13
- Product principles (e.g., community reviews more valuable than professional movie reviewers) and clearly ordered priorities (e.g., privacy, ease-of-use, etc.) help resolve arguments during discovery

## Chapter  14
- Product Council sets product strategy (not business strategy) by reviewing opportunities (to investigate), prototypes (to develop), products (to release)
  - At each stage, the accuracy of estimates should increase (from Small/Big to quite detailed)
- Product Council does not give design input or review minor changes/fixes
- Product Council made up of managers (they can represent the views of anyone else who wants input)
- Product Council meeting frequency varies (could be monthly, weekly, etc)

## Chapter  15
- Customer Advisory Boards are recruited (as volunteers) to help define new products and serve as references at launch
- Generally customers are keen to join, so be careful to keep the board small (<=10) and representative
- Customers must understand that the product is for general use, not a custom solution

## Chapter  16
- Market research is useful but limited
- Product manager should have direct contact with users

## Chapter  17
- User Personas are useful for prioritisation, and limiting scope
- User Personas should be carefully researched and used much earlier than when designing a solution

## Chapter  18
-  Marty Cagan recommends high fidelity prototype as product spec

## Chapters  19 - 20
- Requirements and design must be done concurrently, with engineering input
- Implementation and design should be done concurrently, but after requirements and design
- Use high fidelity prototypes to test ideas, don't wait for implementation
- Concurrently do requirements and design (test w prototypes), THEN implementation and testing

## Chapter  21
- Before handing over specification, test for feasibility, usability (can user do task with prototype), value (does user care)
- Cagan again insists on high-fidelity prototypes (apparently tools exist which can produce these in a few hours or days)

## Chapter  22
- Test prototypes using volunteers, people from a charter user program, or selected users
- Define the task to be tested
- Test user behaviour before showig prototype, e.g., by seeing what they search for on Google when starting a task
- Find out how user currently works, what they think of the prototype, etc.
- With incomplete prototype, asking users what they expect to come after dead ends is useful
- Can test in informal settings, or at users' offices
- Product manager should attend all user testing, can bring along someone from product or engineering
- Chat more after the test than before to get better info
- Stress that the prototype is unfinished, and it (not the user) is being tested
- What the user does is more informative than what they say (i.e., their suggestions should not be accepted directly)
- Don't help the test subject
- Unsuccessful testing indicates successfully avoiding months of wasted effort

## Chapter  24
- Be careful of change, consider comms, deploying regionally, opt-in, etc... "gentle deployment"

## Chapter  25
- Allocate a few days to a week post release as a "rapid response" phase to fix defects, collect metrics, etc.

## Chapter  26
- Regarding Agile environments: Product should be a few sprints ahead of engineering, let engineering decide how to break things up, etc.

## Chapter  27
- Regarding waterfall environments: Validate with prototypes early, be thoughtful about whether to make changes during or after current phase.

## Chapter  30
- Succeeding in large companies:
  - Identify true decision makers and what persuades them
  - Demonstrate ideas rather than talk about them
  - May need to do things personally rather than get permission
  - Avoid meetings, never use them for discussion, get consensus personally
  - Make friends, share information, get support from manager

## Chapter  35
- Very early adopters are excited by new technology, unlike most customers, and should therefore be paid little attention
- Early adopters are emotional (usually motivated by frustration), and essential to generating enough energy needed to grow a product

## Chapter  38
- Consider end user as well as buyer
- Consider the market (e.g., if users are non-technical the product must be easy to use)
- Users are generally not excited about new releases if it creates more work
