From [Using Velocity by Timothy Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/navigating-complexity-in-your-organization/using-velocity):

Thriving in a complex and rapidly changing environment requires:
- "Dynamic Learning", i.e., learning in every moment, not checking out
- Self awareness, of what you are thinking, how you are feeling, how you are interacting with others
- Self discipline and healthy habits (nutrition, sleep, exercise, work limits, fun)

Uncertainty should be handled by
- Accept the certainty of uncertainty
- Instead of exercising control, observe and adapt

There are three essential people skills
- Communicate clearly
- Form connections (i.e., be liked)
- Collaboration (coordinating people can be seen as similar to conducting an orchestra)

Ways to improve emotional intelligence
- Notice people's body language, etc, to observe what they're thinking and feeling (practise this)
- Go into conflicts strategically (me: or perhaps better, transform them into collaboration)
- Practise active listening (incl. monitoring body language)
- Withold judgement
- Adjust communication based on audience and their preferences
- Be generous and add value to others (this builds networks that can be used to deliver outcomes)
- Being rushed can make collaboration hard or impossible
- Leverage people's strengths and unique insights
- Listening to what people complain about indicates what they consider respectful behaviour
- Good ideas are simple, flexible, and robust (not perfect)
